        <p class="abt-text">Growing up in the Western foothills of Maine, I was a bright and ambitious kid, with an eye for tech and a passion for music. Initially, I chased that musical ambition. I ended up getting into an elite music school, and I <em>hated</em> it. It was the most demoralizing, soul-sucking experience of my life. Luckily, around the time I was wondering if I could escape the hell I'd found myself in, I met a woman, and found in her the greatest partner I could ever ask for. She encouraged me to do what I do best: take the leap no matter how stupid it may seem. She invited me to move to Canada, and I was delighted at the oppurtunity to start a new life. I spent ages looking for my new career path, one that fit my wants and needs for a job and also could keep us safe, and as I looked more into web development I realized it was pretty much everything I needed. Now, I'm taking the leap, learning every day, and growing as a dev.</p>

            <li class="abtlist">Quick Learner/Implementer: This website was launch-ready 7 days after my decision to learn coding. <br> I can pick up anything I'm taught very quickly, and use it immediately.</li>
            <li class="abtlist">Problem Solver: I'm extremely good at thinking on my feet and finding solutions, <br> especially in unorthodox ways.</li>
            <li class="abtlist">Challenge-Crusher: I love to dive in just a <em>liiiittle</em> over my head, take on a challenge, <br> and become a better version of myself to overcome it.</li>
            <li class="abtlist">Good Team Player: There is quite literally nothing I can't do when on a team.</li>
            <li class="abtlist">Looking to Grow: I'm not super experienced yet. I'm comfy with HTML/CSS and I'm about to start diving into JavaScript, <br> but in a working environment I know I can grow tenfold.</li>
